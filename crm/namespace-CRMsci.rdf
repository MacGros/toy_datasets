            Fluids are generally defined by the continuity criterion which is characteristic of their substance: their amorphous matter is continuous
            and tends to flow. Therefore, contiguous amounts of matter within a fluid body may stay contiguous or at least be locally spatially
            confined for a sufficiently long time in order to be temporarily identified and traced. This is a much weaker concept of stability of form
            than the one we would apply to what one would call a physical object. In general, an instance of Fluid Body may gain or lose matter over
            time through so-called sources or sinks in its surface, in contrast to physical things, which may lose or gain matter by exchange of

            of a kind relevant for the mission of the observation or regarded as potentially relevant for some community (identity). This observation
            produces knowledge about the existence of the respective thing at a particular place in or on surrounding matter. This knowledge may be
            new to the group of people the actor belongs to. In that case we would talk about a discovery. The observer may recognize or assign an
            individual identity of the thing encountered or regard only the type as noteworthy in the associated documentation or report. In
            archaeology there is a particular interest if an object is found “in situ”, i.e. if its embedding in the surrounding matter supports the

An instance of S20 Physical Feature also represents the place it occupies with respect to the surrounding matter. More precisely, it is the maximal real volume in space that an instance of S20 Physical Feature is occupying during its lifetime with respect to the default reference space relative to which the feature is at rest. In cases of features on or in the surface of earth, the default reference is typically fixed to the closer environment of the tectonic plate or sea floor. In cases of features on mobile objects, the reference space is typically fixed to the geometry of the bearing object.
Instances of E26 Physical Feature share many of the attributes of instances of E19 Physical Object. They may have a one-, two- or three-dimensional geometric extent, but there are no natural borders that separate them completely in an objective way from the carrier objects. For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not.
Instances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colors, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature.
This definition coincides with the definition of "fiat objects" (Smith and Varzi, 2000, pp.401-420), with the exception of aggregates of “bona fide objects”.</rdfs:comment>

            interest for and investigations of the geometric arrangement of physical features or parts of them on or within the specified S22 Segment
            of Matter. It comes into existence as being an object of discourse through S4 Observation or declaration and is restricted to the time
            span starting after the last change through an S18 Alteration before the S4 Observation or declaration and ending with the next S18

            empirical evidence, experiments and by measurements. We define observation in the sense of natural sciences, as a kind of human activity:
            at some Place and within some Time-Span, certain Physical Things and their behavior and interactions are observed, either directly by
            human sensory impression, or enhanced with tools and measurement devices. The output of the internal processes of measurement devices that
            do not require additional human interaction are in general regarded as part of the observation and not as additional inference. Manual
            recordings may serve as additional evidence. Measurements and witnessing of events are special cases of observations. Observations result
            in a belief about certain propositions. In this model, the degree of confidence in the observed properties is regarded to be “true” per
            default, but could be described differently by adding a property P3 has note to an instance of S4 Observation, or by reification of the
            property O16 observed value. Primary data from measurement devices are regarded in this model to be results of observation and can be

            represent the transition between reality and propositions in the form of instances of a formal ontology, and can be subject to data

This class allows the documentation of how the respective assignment came about, and whose opinion it was. All the attributes or properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly attached to the respective item or concept, possibly as a collection of contradictory values. All cases of properties in this model that are also described indirectly through an action are characterised as "short cuts" of this action. This redundant modelling of two alternative views is preferred because many implementations may have good reasons to model either the action or the short cut, and the relation between both alternatives can be captured by simple rules.
In particular, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain museum procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on if this information should be accessible by structured queries.</rdfs:comment>

The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage.

Depending on the existence of natural boundaries of such things, the CRM distinguishes the instances of E19 Physical Object from instances of E26 Physical Feature, such as holes, rivers, pieces of land etc. Most instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy), whereas features are integral to the surrounding matter.
An instance of E18 Physical Thing occupies not only a particular geometric space, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces, such as the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a number of individually contiguous spacetime volumes equal to the number of unconnected objects that constitute the set.
We model E18 Physical Thing to be a subclass of E72 Legal Object and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E18 Physical Thing without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E18 Physical Thing is matter while a spacetime volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded to be unique to it, due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.
The CIDOC CRM is generally not concerned with amounts of matter in fluid or gaseous states.</rdfs:comment>

Such changes of state will affect instances of E77 Persistent Item or its subclasses.
The distinction between an E5 Event and an E4 Period is partly a question of the scale of observation. Viewed at a coarse level of detail, an E5 Event is an ‘instantaneous’ change of state. At a fine level, the E5 Event can be analysed into its component phenomena within a space and time frame, and as such can be seen as an E4 Period. The reverse is not necessarily the case: not all instances of E4 Period give rise to a noteworthy change of state.</rdfs:comment>

The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.
It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.
Any object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a "section" of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination.</rdfs:comment>

An instance of E54 Dimension represents the true quantity, independent from its numerical approximation, e.g. in inches or in cm. The properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of an instance of E54 Dimension. If the true values belong to a non-discrete space, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that interoperability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.
Numerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension as appropriate.</rdfs:comment>

				<rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">This property associates an instance of S4 Observation with the instance of S9 Property Type for which the observation provides a value or evidence, such as “concentration of nitrate” observed the water from a particular borehole. Encoding the observed property by type, observed entity and value (properties O9, O10, O16) is a method to circumscribe the reification of the observed property by the respective instance of S4 Observation. In an RDFS encoding, this circumscription can be transformed into an explicit representation of the observed property in terms of a formal ontology either by use of a reification construct or by the use of a Named Graph containing the observed property. The latter representation allows for more formal reasoning with the model, the former is more flexible about the kinds of observations.</rdfs:comment>
